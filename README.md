# Budget-Track

• The program evaluates the budget transactions entered in the 
'transactions.txt' file in line with the budget information 
saved in the 'budget.txt' file by the user.

• The program prints the result of the evaluation on the screen 
at the end of the program.

• The program reads data in 'budget.txt' and 'transactions.txt' 
files.

• In order for the data to be read, the files must be in the same 
directory as the source code folder.

• The 'budget.txt' file should contain three different data types 
as category number, category budget and category name.

• A 'space' must be left between each data type. This way, the 
program will understand what data it is reading.

• Do not use the 'space' key while entering data. For example, 
use 'car expense' instead of 'car expenses' for the category 
name.

• You can enter the data you want such as 'budget.txt' and 
'transactions.txt' files given as examples and delete whatever 
you want.

• Use the 'budget.txt' file to add new category information.

• 'Transaction.txt to add new transaction information. Use the 
file.

• Please delete the category information about which there is 
no action in the 'transactions.txt' file from the 'budget.txt' 
file. Otherwise, the program will not work properly.

• You can follow the values entered into the program and the 
results of the operations on the console screen
